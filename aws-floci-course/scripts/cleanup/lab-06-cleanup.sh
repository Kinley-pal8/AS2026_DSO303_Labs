============================================================
  This deletes the USMS enrolment service's SCALING only:
    - both scheduled actions
    - all three scaling policies, and with them the four
      CloudWatch alarms target tracking created for you
    - the custom alarm usms-enrolment-queue-high
    - the scalable target registration

  It does NOT touch the ECS service, the task definition,
  the cluster, the load balancer or the target group. After
  this runs, usms-enrolment-svc stays exactly as it is at
  desiredCount 2 -- it simply has nothing deciding to
  change that number.

  The CloudWatch lab and the CloudFormation lab use parts
  of this. None of it is reversible from here, but all of
  it is rebuildable from templates/ in about 15 minutes.

cat <<'KEPT'
  AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_ECSService
    One per account, shared by every ECS service that ever scales. Removing it
    is 'aws iam delete-service-linked-role', and it is the account owner's
    decision rather than a lab's.

  The USMS/Enrolment custom metric
    CloudWatch metrics CANNOT be deleted. They stop being published, and the
    datapoints expire on CloudWatch's own retention schedule. If you were
    expecting a delete-metric call, there is not one, and that is worth
    remembering before you invent a metric name you will regret.

  usms-enrolment-svc, its task definition, its cluster, its load balancer
    Untouched. lab-05-cleanup.sh and lab-04-cleanup.sh own those, in that
    order, and they will now agree to run.
